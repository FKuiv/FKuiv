# About me

Started coding in middle school. Doing simple web projects like a calculator and CLI games in Python. In high school created a few games in Unity and learned more about React and web development. After high school I went to the Estonian Defence Forces for my conscription. My job there was to do everything related to DevOps and infrastructure. I also volunteered for other developments such as helping to build the website for the [Blue Flower Tour](https://sinilillerannak.ee/) and I was lucky to take part in [Locked Shields 2024](https://ccdcoe.org/exercises/locked-shields/). This is one of the largest cyber defence exercises in the western world.
