# About me

Started coding in middle school. Doing simple web projects like a calculator and CLI games in Python. In high school created a few games in Unity and learned more about React and web development. After high school I went to the Estonian Defence Forces for my conscription. My job there was to do everything related to DevOps and infrastructure. I also volunteered for other developments such as helping to build the website for the [Blue Flower Tour](https://sinilillerannak.ee/) and I was lucky to take part in [Locked Shields 2024](https://ccdcoe.org/exercises/locked-shields/). This is one of the largest cyber defence exercises in the western world.

During the conscription and now I am also doing some freelancing. I have done a few solutions for [Kiek in de KÃ¶k](https://linnamuuseum.ee/en/kiek-in-de-kok/) and [Rahvusarhiiv](https://www.ra.ee/). Also I have been working with [Andry Pedak](https://www.pedak.me/) on a few projects. I have been using Javascript, Typescript, Svelte and Sveltekit for all the freelance projects.

Currently trying to learn as much as I can about computer science and everything related to it. Starting to make my first projects in the realm of machine learning as well.
