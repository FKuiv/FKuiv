# About me

Started coding in middle school. Doing simple web projects like a calculator and CLI games in Python. In high school created a few games in Unity and learned more about React and web development. Currently serving my time in the cyber divison of Estonian Defence Forces. Currently doing mostly DevOps stuff but also volunteering for other developments such as helping to build the website for the [Blue Flower Tour](https://sinilillerannak.ee/). Also I am taking part in [Locked Shields 2024](https://ccdcoe.org/exercises/locked-shields/). This is one of the largest cyber defence exercises in the western world. 

Currently trying to learn as much as I can about computer science and everything related to it.

# Future

After I have finished my time in the EDF, I am going to study computer science in [TalTech](https://taltech.ee/en/).
